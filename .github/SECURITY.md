# 🔒 Security Policy

We take security issues in the Lootils project seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible so that we can take the necessary steps to address the issue.

## ❗ Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to youarenotmido@gmail.com with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## 🚨 Security Updates

When a security vulnerability is discovered, we will take immediate action to resolve the issue and deploy a fix to the production environment.

## 🔒 Keeping Your Account Secure

To keep your Lootils account secure, we recommend the following:

- Use a strong, unique password for your email account associated with your OAuth provider.
- Be cautious when granting permissions to third-party applications through OAuth.
- Regularly review your connected applications in your OAuth provider's settings to ensure that there are no unauthorized access attempts.
